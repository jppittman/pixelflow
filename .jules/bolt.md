## 2025-12-28 - Inherent Methods Shadowing Optimized Trait Implementations
**Learning:** I discovered that `Jet3` and `Jet2` had optimized `sqrt` implementations in their `Numeric` trait implementation, but their *inherent* `sqrt` methods (which shadow the trait methods when called directly) were still using the unoptimized slow path.
**Action:** Always check both trait implementations AND inherent methods when optimizing types in Rust, as inherent methods take precedence and might be legacy/unoptimized code.

## 2025-12-28 - Optimized Keybinding Lookups
**Learning:** `KeybindingsConfig` stored bindings as a `Vec`, causing O(n) lookup overhead on every keypress.
**Action:** Refactored `KeybindingsConfig` to maintain a `HashMap` for O(1) lookups while keeping the `Vec` for serialization/deserialization compatibility using `#[serde(from/into)]`. This ensures performance without breaking config file format.

## 2025-12-28 - AST Optimization and Parentheses
**Learning:** In the `pixelflow-macros` AST optimizer, I initially removed `Expr::Paren` wrappers assuming they were redundant during optimization recursion. This broke operator precedence (e.g., `(X - offset).abs()` became logic that failed tests).
**Action:** When implementing AST transformations, always preserve grouping/parentheses nodes unless you perform a specific precedence check proving they are redundant.

## 2025-12-28 - Rasterizer Inner Loop Hoisting
**Learning:** The inner loop of `execute_stripe` was re-evaluating `Field::sequential(start)` on every iteration, which involves multiple SIMD instructions (broadcast/load + add).
**Action:** Hoisted the initialization of `xs` out of the loop and updated it incrementally using a pre-computed `step` vector. This reduced the inner loop overhead significantly, yielding a ~34% improvement in rasterization throughput.

## 2024-05-24 - StyleEnforcer: Refactoring Boolean Arguments to Enums
**Learning:** Found that `STYLE.md` recommends refactoring boolean arguments into descriptive enums or separate methods (e.g. `set_visible(bool)` to `show()` and `hide()`). When performing this refactor on a message enum like `DisplayControl::SetVisible`, it requires tracking down all usages across different platform implementations (`macos`, `linux`) and updating matching logic and underlying platform window methods to ensure the refactor is complete. Pre-existing compilation errors in `pixelflow-graphics` may mask new errors in dependent crates like `pixelflow-runtime` if running a workspace-wide `cargo check`.
**Action:** Always run a crate-specific check (e.g., `cargo check -p pixelflow-runtime`) to isolate your changes from known failures in other workspace crates.
